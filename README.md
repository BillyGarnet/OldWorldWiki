# OldWorldWiki
Imagine a wiki combined with a fantasy world. Gamers, story writers, make believers can share in the creation and development of a combined world. Add history, dungeons or infrastructure.

The engine underneath it all is DungeonImp. DungeonImp will store history, cities, dungeons, and all the information to make the world rich.
The information is currently stored in JSON files.

Developers are encouraged to build new clients to make calls to DungeonImp for information.
